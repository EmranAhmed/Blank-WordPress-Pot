Blank WordPress Pot allows developpers to have a great starting point for their translations pot files.

## Description ##

Developpers sometimes get confused when they start talking about translations. Blank WordPress Pot gives them the starting point to create the ready to translate pot.file.
In a few clicks your WordPress's plugin or extension will be ready to incorporate your translated strings. No more default.po or pot without the right settings.


### Features of the file include ###

* Right propreties set (utf-8, plurals).
* Right path set.
* All keywords include.


### How does it work? ###

1. Create the languages folder right at the base of your root folder.
2. Put Blank-WordPress.pot inside.
3. Rename it with the slug of your plugin or extension.
4. In catalog -> preferences -> settings : change the properties to match your WordPress file name -> ok.
5. Push the update button in poedit main ui to fetch your translated strings.
6. Save (if a notice ask you to pick a language just pick "none of this").
7. Exit and that's it. 

Now the translators have a pot file ready to be used, no more hassle for you and for them...
